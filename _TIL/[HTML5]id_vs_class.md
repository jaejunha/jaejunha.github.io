## id vs class
If we want to call some elements later, then we usually use keyword: **id** or **class**  
They have different role  
If you want to use unique characteristic **to only one element**, then **keyword: id** is used  
However, if you want to unique characteristc **to many elements**, then **keyword: class** is used
