Professor suggested studying MCNL material.<br>
From today, I will study "Compressed Video over Network"<br>
Especially, I will study chapter 1, 2, 6, 8, 9.<br>
<br>
**video coding standards**:**bitstream syntax**, **language** which will be used by decoder and encoder.<br>
Good compression algorithm is also needed.<br>
Mainly **H.263** will be treated.<br>
<br>
Because **there are a large number of bits**, compression is prerequisite.<br>
Two main organization : **ITU-T**, **ISO**<br>
difference : **operating bit rates**, **applications**<br>
<br>
two types of redundancy : **spatial**, **temporal**<br>
spatial coding is like intra coding<br>
temporal coding is like inter coding<br>
pixel has three components : **one luminance**, **two chrominance**<br>
<br>
H.263 uses block-based coding scheme.<br>
<br>
**Transform Coding**<br>
**Motion Compensation**<br>
<br>
Coding Mode<br>
- UMV(Unrestricted Motion Vector)<br>
- SAC(Syntax-Based Arithmetic Coding<br>
- Advanced Prediction Mode<br>
- PB Frame Mode<br>
- Advanced Intra Coding Mode<br>
- Alternate Inter VLC Mode<br>
- Modified Quantization Mode<br>
- Deblocking Filter Mode<br>
- Improved PB Frame Mode<br>
<br>
Remainder will be studied tomorrow.<br>
<br>

## Must do<br>
I will study materials recommended by professor.<br>
<br>

## Extra<br>
make network component with illustrator<br>
